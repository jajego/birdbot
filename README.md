## Ginkgo 
Ginkgo is a Discord bot that makes requests to ornell University's Lab of Cornithology eBird API to provide server members with constantly updated bird sighting data from around the world. It provides the ability to query by region, a pair of coordinate points, or species. It also scrapes the Internet for high resolution photos of each sighted bird and caches the links for future use.
