NEW FEATURES
****************************************************************************************
- Display species queries more sensibly since it's not visually interesting rn
- give it a species name and get code back
- Have info auto display when bird is centered on screen?


PERFORMANCE
****************************************************************************************
- Cache links on the server so scraper only gets run once
    --> POST request to new .json file(cachedLinks.json?)
    --> schema: queryId (text), links (text/list)
    --> Will require React frontend to GET the server for links instead of checking local storage


BUGS
****************************************************************************************
- Landing resizing is currently funky
    --> Overall should be condensed
